/**
 * Messaging Feature - Complete Implementation
 * 
 * This file provides an overview of the messaging feature implementation,
 * including all components, screens, navigation, and integration points.
 * 
 * FEATURE STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
 * ===============================
 * 
 * ✅ TypeScript interfaces and types
 * ✅ Mock data with realistic conversation scenarios  
 * ✅ Shared UI components (MessageBubble, ConversationList, MessageComposer)
 * ✅ Client messaging screens (inbox and conversation)
 * ✅ Trainer messaging screens (client management and conversation)
 * ✅ Navigation integration (stack navigators and tab integration)
 * ✅ Dashboard integration (navigation from home screens)
 * ✅ Feature flag controls (MESSAGING_ENABLED, REALTIME_ENABLED)
 * ✅ Comprehensive Supabase integration documentation
 * 
 * DELIVERABLES COMPLETED
 * =====================
 * 
 * 1. Data Models & Types (/types/index.ts)
 *    - Message interface with sender/receiver/content/timestamps
 *    - Conversation interface with participant info and unread counts
 *    - MessageRequest and ConversationFilter interfaces
 * 
 * 2. Mock Data (/data/mockData.ts)
 *    - Realistic conversation data between clients and trainers
 *    - Helper functions: getConversations(), getMessages(), sendMessage()
 *    - Read receipt and conversation management utilities
 *    - Comprehensive Supabase migration documentation
 * 
 * 3. Shared Components (/components/)
 *    - MessageBubble: Individual message display with timestamps and read receipts
 *    - ConversationList: Scrollable list with unread indicators and avatars
 *    - MessageComposer: Text input with send functionality and large touch targets
 *    - All optimized for seniors: large fonts, high contrast, accessible design
 * 
 * 4. Client Screens (/screens/)
 *    - ClientMessagesScreen: Inbox view with conversation list
 *    - ClientConversationScreen: Individual chat with trainer
 *    - Real-time subscription comments and error handling
 * 
 * 5. Trainer Screens (/screens/)
 *    - TrainerMessagesScreen: Client inbox with conversation management
 *    - TrainerConversationScreen: Individual chat with client context
 *    - Professional interface with client information display
 * 
 * 6. Navigation Integration (/navigation/)
 *    - ClientMessagingNavigator: Stack navigation for client messaging
 *    - TrainerMessagingNavigator: Stack navigation for trainer messaging
 *    - Tab navigator integration with proper routing
 *    - Dashboard card navigation from home screens
 * 
 * SUPABASE INTEGRATION ROADMAP
 * ============================
 * 
 * All functions are documented with specific Supabase queries and real-time
 * subscriptions. Key integration points:
 * 
 * 1. Database Tables:
 *    - messages: Core messaging data with RLS policies
 *    - conversations_view: Aggregated conversation data
 *    - user profiles: Participant information and avatars
 * 
 * 2. Real-time Features (when REALTIME_ENABLED):
 *    - New message notifications
 *    - Read receipt broadcasting
 *    - Typing indicators
 *    - Live conversation updates
 * 
 * 3. Authentication Integration:
 *    - User context for sender/receiver identification
 *    - Role-based access control (client/trainer permissions)
 *    - Secure message filtering by participant
 * 
 * DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
 * =================
 * 
 * Senior-Friendly Design:
 * - Large touch targets (minimum 44pt)
 * - High contrast colors
 * - Large, readable fonts (18px+ body text)
 * - Simple, clean interface
 * - Clear visual hierarchy
 * - Accessible navigation patterns
 * 
 * Professional Communication:
 * - Appropriate tone and context
 * - Client information display for trainers
 * - Session context integration
 * - Future support for quick replies and templates
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
 * ===================
 * 
 * Ready for implementation when needed:
 * - Image and file sharing
 * - Voice messages
 * - Video call integration
 * - Message templates and quick replies
 * - Push notifications
 * - Message search and filtering
 * - Conversation archiving
 * - Group messaging for classes
 * 
 * USAGE EXAMPLES
 * ==============
 * 
 * Client Flow:
 * 1. Client opens Messages tab
 * 2. Sees conversation list with trainer
 * 3. Taps conversation to open chat
 * 4. Types and sends message
 * 5. Receives real-time response from trainer
 * 
 * Trainer Flow:
 * 1. Trainer opens Messages tab
 * 2. Sees all client conversations with unread counts
 * 3. Taps client conversation to respond
 * 4. Sees client context (next session, progress)
 * 5. Sends motivational message or scheduling update
 * 
 * This messaging system provides a solid foundation for client-trainer
 * communication while maintaining the app's focus on fitness and seniors.
